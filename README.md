# Kevin Mugenyi

Computer Science student at Mbarara University of Science and Technology.  
I build software with a focus on practical problem-solving, interactive systems, and data-driven applications.

My work explores web technologies, problem-solving tech solutions, gesture-based human–computer interaction, and applied computing concepts such as signal processing and system design. I enjoy learning by building and prefer projects that solve real problems or experiment with new ideas.

Most repositories here reflect ongoing learning, academic work, and personal experimentation.
